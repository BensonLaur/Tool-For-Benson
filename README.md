# ToolForBenson


This is a application design for myself ,which implements the functions I want.


The functions include sign in and Favorites so far. And the functions have been building......

###Requiment:
This project is ran with VC++6.0 IDE,althouth the API I use is traditional windows API, which
is what I am learning.



###Application description:

0, The language of UI is Chinese.

1, the app has two function so far : one is sign in ,and the other is favorites.

   1) sign in: users can add new or delete exesting Sign in item, and sign in every day;
               users also can show the basic data in a specified range of time in two way: digit statistic and histogram.

   2) favorites: users can save local path or online link ,and manage them in different floder.

2, the app are design modulare, a function is a module, if I want to add a new module,

   I just need to add new new name to the char** structure and add corresponding 
code,modulare design make
 it easy to do that.
